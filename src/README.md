# src/

This folder contains all the analysis source code. Domain-specific subfolders each have their own README; this file describes the shared scripts at the src/ root that are used across domains.

## Shared scripts

-   `participant_id.R`: defines `normalize_participant_id()`, which standardizes participant ID strings to `PREFIX_NN` format (e.g. `OPT-7` → `OPT_07`). Sourced by most pipeline scripts.
-   `normalize_participant_ids.R`: standalone audit script that reads key raw tables and reports any participant IDs that `normalize_participant_id()` would change.
-   `merge_files.R`: joins the cleaned characteristics and dietary outputs to the mycobiome sample data and writes `data/processed/merged.csv`.

## Subfolders
